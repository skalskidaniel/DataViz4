The frothy head rest nicely on top of the beer. A great first impression. The nose and flavor pick up right where the pour left off, with an excellent mix of sweet malt and bitter hop components. This is impressively balanced from a flavor profile perspective, and also incredibly easy drinking for a 9% beer. This is an excellent Imperial Red, right up there with some of my favorites in the \"style,\" I would happily drink this again."

A Foolish Wit was our original Belgian style wit beer, brewed with amchoor, (dried green mango), lemony sumac, and traditional green coriander. This is a wit that even those wielding the sharpest of tongues will enjoy. Light, bright, and full of lemony wheat flavor, this ale is ripe with mischief."

Vineyards here date back to the mid-1800s when the Silverado Trail was just a quiet horse path. Cabernet Sauvignon became Napa's star during the 1976 Judgment of Paris, when Stags Leap took first place over the French First Growth Bordeaux's Mouton-Rothschild and Haut Brion. The staggering impact of the \"win\" was reinforced ten years later when the same wines were tasted a second time. The winner was a Stags Leap Cabernet Sauvignon, 1972 Clos Du Val. As Karen MacNeil says \"when you taste a typical Stags Leap District wine, you understand what all the fuss is about.\" These reds are all about textural hedonism, softness and intensity."
